# qemu

Reference scripts for qemu while I was doing testing for `microvm`. I deleted the actual `microvm` one by accident, but
that is okay as it was fairly straight forward to configure. Unfortunately, the farthest I was able to get to was
booting up the kernel and minimal `alpine` environment (as the initramfs) with no block device and networking support.

At some point, I would like to revisit `microvm`.
